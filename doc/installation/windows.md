You need to get a [license][5] and follow the instructions within the mail from HashiCorp.

## Shared Filesystem

### NFS

If you want to use nfs instead of the default shared filesystem of the provider, for example for performance reasons,
or cause the kernel module of the provider does problem, you need to install the `vagrant-winnfsd` vagrant plugin.

```{.sh}
vagrant plugin install vagrant-winnfsd
```

## Usage

Press `Windows` Key, enter `git bash`, press `ctrl + shif + enter`. You get a simple a bash shell which supports most
simple unix commands, which allows you to use the [create-symfony-project][6] for example.

### Virtualbox

While `winnfsd` got a much better read performance than `vboxfs` i suggest to prefere it for all read operations
But for `composer install` or other write intensive operations its faster to change the `sharetype` to `native`
and reboot the virtual machine by calling `vagrant halt && vagrant up` within the bash.
